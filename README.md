## Reflection

This was a personal project I worked on for over a month. I built this project with the goal of practicing user authentication and authorization using JWT. I set out to build a full stack website where users can register and sign into accounts, create their own blog posts, and leave comments under other blog posts.

This project was challenging because I never built a full stack application prior to this one, and I never implemented user authentication or authorization in a project before. I learned so much from this project.

I ran into many obstacles while working on this project such as getting the front end to communicate with the backend, user authentication, user authorization, routing, etc...
